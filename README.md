## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an AI school project where I and two group members [Che Shao Chen](https://github.com/Bill1119) and [Yuan Zhang](https://github.com/FloatMineArm) to implement a Naive Bayes algorithms form scratch.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This project contains 4 Python files for the implementation.
1. CountVectorizer : Responsible for computing the vector of frequency for each document.
2. Main : Contains the main method, where program execution begin.
3. NaiveBayes : Responsible for training and prediction.
4. PreProcess : Responsible for processing the texts. Folds all characters to lowercase, then tokenize them using 
 regular expression and uses the set of resulting words as the vocabulary.
