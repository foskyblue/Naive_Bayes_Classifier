# Naive_Bayes_Classifier

The project consists of four (4) classes:
 <li>CountVectorizer : Responsible for computing the vector of frequency for each document</li>
 <li>Main : Contains the main method, where program execution begin.</li>
 <li>NaiveBayes : Responsible for training and prediction</li>
 <li>PreProcess : Responsible for processing the texts. Folds all characters to lowercase, then tokenize them using 
 regular expression and uses the set of resulting words as the vocabulary.</li>
 
 ### How to run:
 This program was written using Python 3.7
 <li>Dependencies: Numpy, re</li>
 <br>
 After cloning/downloading, be sure that the training and test samples are available in ../datasets/train/ and 
 ../datasets/test folders respectively.
 
 Start execution from the Main class. After completion the following files are generated:
 <li>model.txt file with the information
   <ol>
    <li>A line counter i, followed by 2 spaces.</li>
    <li>The word w<sub>i</sub>, followed by 2 spaces.</li>
    <li>The frequency of w<sub>i</sub> in the class ham, followed by 2 spaces.</li>
    <li>The smoothed conditional probability of w<sub>i</sub> in the class ham −P(w<sub>i</sub>|ham), followed by 2 spaces.</li>
    <li>The frequency of w<sub>i</sub> in the class spam, followed by 2 spaces</li>
    <li>The smoothed conditional probability of w<sub>i</sub> in the class spam −P(w<sub>i</sub>|spam), followed by a carriage return.</li>
   </ol>
  is generated and saved in the output_files folder located in the root folder.</li>
 <li>result.txt file with the information 
   <ol>
    <li>A line counter i, followed by 2 spaces.</li>
    <li>the name of the test file, followed by 2 spaces</li>
    <li>the classification as given by your classifier (the label spam or ham), followed by 2 spaces</li>
    <li>the score of the class ham as given by your classifier, followed by 2 spaces</li>
    <li>the score of the class spam as given by your classifier, followed by 2 spaces</li>
    <li>the correct classification of the file, followed by 2 spaces</li>
    <li>the label right or wrong (depending on the case), followed by a carriage return</li>
   </ol>
 is generated and saved in the output_files folder located in the root folder.</li>
 
 Accuracy, precision, recall and f1-measure are computed for spam and ham classes.
 Accuracy, precision, recall and f1-measure are computed for the overall system.
